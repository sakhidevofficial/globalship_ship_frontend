              Welcome to Cartzilla! These Terms and Conditions (&quot;Terms&quot;) govern your access to and use of the
              Cartzilla website and mobile application (collectively referred to as the &quot;Platform&quot;). Please
              read these Terms carefully before using the Platform. By accessing or using the Platform, you agree to be
              bound by these Terms.
            </p>
            <h2 className="h4 pt-3 pt-lg-4">1. Overview</h2>
            <p>
              Cartzilla provides an online platform that enables users to purchase groceries and other products from
              local stores and have them delivered to their designated location. By using the Platform, you acknowledge
              and agree that Cartzilla is not a store or retailer but merely acts as an intermediary to facilitate
              transactions between users and participating stores.
            </p>
            <p>
              Welcome to the family of websites and applications provided by Cartzilla. These Terms of Use govern your
              access to and use of all Cartzilla Sites, among other things. By using the Cartzilla Sites, you affirm

              these Terms of Use on your behalf. If you violate or do not agree to these Terms of Use, then your access
              to and use of the Cartzilla Sites is unauthorized. Additional terms and conditions apply to some services
              offered on the Cartzilla Sites (e.g., Cartzilla Pharmacy, Cartzilla +, and Gift Cards) or through other
              channels. Those terms and conditions can be found where the relevant service is offered on the Cartzilla
              Sites or otherwise and are incorporated into these Terms of Use by reference.
