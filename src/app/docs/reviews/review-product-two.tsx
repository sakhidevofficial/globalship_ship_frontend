      While the design of the chair is nice and it does add a touch of retro vibe to my space, I found the quality
      to be lacking. After just a few weeks of use, one of the legs started to wobble, and the seat isn&apos;t as
      comfortable as I had hoped. Disappointed with the durability. Additionally, the assembly process was a bit
      frustrating as some of the screws didn&apos;t align properly with the holes, requiring extra effort to secure them
      in place. Overall, while it looks good, I expected better quality for the price.
